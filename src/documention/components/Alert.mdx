# Alert

```javascript
import Alert from '@tzero/tzero-component-library/dist/Alert';
```

Alerts are to assist communication between the user and the UI

## Properties

<Props of={Alert} />

## Colors
* You can pass in anything with the children prop or use the title, description props for auto sizing

<Playground>
  <Alert
    color="primary"
    description="We are only accepting limit orders that are good until the close of market."
    title="Market Hours 9:30am - 4:00pm EST"
  />
  <Alert
    color="success"
    description="We are only accepting limit orders that are good until the close of market."
    title="Market Hours 9:30am - 4:00pm EST"
  />
  <Alert
    color="danger"
    description="We are only accepting orders.."
    title="Market Hours 9:30am - 4:00pm EST"
  />
</Playground>

## Controlled Alert
* Use the collapse or fade prop (or both!) for a smoother transition
* Or set them to false if you don't want an animated transition (for some reason..)

<Playground>
  <Component
    initialState={{
      isOpen1: true,
      isOpen2: true,
      isOpen3: true,
    }}
  >
    {({ setState, state }) => (
      <>
        <Alert
          color="primary"
          isOpen={state.isOpen1}
          onClose={() => setState({ isOpen1: false})}
        >
          This primary alert can be closed/controlled
        </Alert>
        <Alert
          color="success"
          isOpen={state.isOpen2}
          onClose={() => setState({ isOpen2: false})}
          collapse={false}
        >
          This success alert has a fade animation
        </Alert>
        <Alert
          color="danger"
          isOpen={state.isOpen3}
          onClose={() => setState({ isOpen3: false})}
        >
          This danger alert has a fade and collapse animation
        </Alert>
        <Button
          onClick={() => setState({
            isOpen1: true,
            isOpen2: true,
            isOpen3: true,
          })}
        >
          Refresh
        </Button>
      </>
    )}
  </Component>
